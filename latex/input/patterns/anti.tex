\begin{frame}{Anti-patterns}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \hhl{God object}, \hhl{The blob}: One massive class containing all functionality
		\item \hhl{Object orgy}: Not using data encapsulation \srem{(not distinguishing between public and private members)}; some objects modify the internals of others more than their own \srem{($\lra$ it is not clear \enquote{who is doing what to whom})}
		\item \hhl{Not using polymorphism}: Having many parallel sections of identical \texttt{if} statements rather than using classes and subclasses
		\item \hhl{Misusing (multiple) inheritance}: Some inherited methods do not make sense for subclass; violations of the Liskov substitution principle
		\item \hhl{Overgeneralization}
	\end{itemize}

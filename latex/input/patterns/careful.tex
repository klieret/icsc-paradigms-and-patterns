	%Common criticism% of programming by patterns:

		\begin{quote}
		\enquote{Repetitive use of the same patterns and lots of boilerplate indicates lack or abstraction or lacking features of your programming language.}
		\end{quote}
	}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item \hhl{Example}: If functions are first-level objects \srem{(can be passed around like normal datatypes)}, I do not \srem{(always)} need to define a strategy class hierarchy. \\
		However, this could still be considered the same \enquote{pattern} \srem{(only with a simpler implementation)}
		\item The \enquote{Patterns} give you \hhl{vocabulary} to describe your problem in an abstract way, even if the implementation details very a lot between languages
		\item Lots of pattern boilerplate should make you think about your design and language choices
		\item Be aware that the implementation of \srem{(or even the need for)} certain patterns can be very dependent on your language features

		\item
		Remember the zen of python: simple is better than complex; but complex is better than complicated
		%
		\item
		Do not introduce complexity \srem{(use the design pattern)} if you do not fully understand why you need it.
		\item
		Some people highlight the KISS \srem{(\underline keep \underline it \underline simple, \underline stupid)} and YAGNI \srem{(\underline you \underline aren't \underline gonna \underline need \underline it)} principle

\begin{frame}{Common criticism}
	\begin{quote}
		\enquote{The common design patterns are often the direct results of thinking about good software design; focusing on patterns replaces actual thought with \hhl{cut-and-paste programming}.}
	\end{quote}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<2-> Take discussion of patterns as a \hhl{mental practice} of thinking about good design; \stress{avoid} simple cut-and-paste
